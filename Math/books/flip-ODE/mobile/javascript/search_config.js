Solution                     By Newton's Law of cooling: The rate of change of an object's temperature (T) is proportional to                    the difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature (A).                      dT  =  −  ( kT −  ) A                      dt                       dT   = − kdt                   Integrate both sides                      T −  A          t                        T                      ∫   T −  A  = − ∫    k dt                            dT                        T                         0           0                                 T          t                      ln T −  A      =  −  kt                                T                                  0         0                      ln T −  A −  ln T −  A =  −  kt                                    0                          −                      ln  TA  = − kt                         Quotient Rule                        T − A                         0                      T −  A  =  e − kt                      T −  A                       0                                         )                     ⇒  T −  A =  ( T −  A e − kt                                   0","34 | 1. 2 - S e p a r a bl e  E qu a t i ons                     Given: T =   40 F°     \&  A =  70 F°                            0                                   )               Tt     70 +  (40 70 e − kt                 ( ) =                              −                    =  70 30e−  − kt                 T (t = 10 ) =  70 3 0e − 10k  =  0 5                              −                    −  30e − 10k  =  −  20                     e − 10k  =  2                            3                              2                    −  10k =  ln                              3                         ln  2                    k =   3                        − 10                     ≈  0.0405                           −                  ( ) =                Tt    70 30e   − 0.0405t                T (t =  30 ) =  70 30e − 0.0405(30)                              −                         ≈  61.1    F°              1.2-4 Losing a solution              When we use separate variables, the variable divisors could be zero at a point.

It is plausible – and true, under ideal conditions – that the velocity of water exiting through the            hole is                            v =  2gy             Which is the velocity a drop of water would acquire in falling freely from the surface of the water to            the hole. One can derive this formula beginning with the assumption that the sum of the kinetic and            potential energy of the system remains constant. Under real conditions, taking into account  the            construction of a water jet from an orifice,  v = c  2gy , where c is an empirical constant between 0             and 1 (usually about 0.6 for a small continuous stream of water). For simplicity, we take c = 1 in the            following discussion.                                                   dV  =  −  av =  −  a  2gy                                                   dt                                            dV  =  −  k y    where k =   a  2g                                            dt             This is a statement of Torricelli’s Law for a draining tank.

One of the famous problems in the history of mathematics is the brachistochrone problem: to                  find the curve along which a particle will slide without friction in the minimum time from one                  given point P to another point Q, the second point being lower than the first but not directly                  beneath it.                  This problem was posed by Johann Bernoulli  in 1696 as a challenge problem to the                  mathematicians of his day. Correct solutions were found by Johann Bernoulli and his brother                  Jakob Bernoulli and by Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, and the Marquis de L’Hospital. The                  brachistochrone  problem is important in  the development of mathematics as one of the                  forerunners of the calculus of variations.                  In solving this problem, it is convenient to take the origin as the upper point P and to orient the                                                                  (                                                                      ,                  axes as shown.

Consider two tanks, label tank A and tank B for reference. Tank A contains 100 gal of solution                       in which is dissolved 20 lb. of salt. Tank B contains 200 gal of solution which is dissolved 40                       lbs. of salt. Pure water flows into the tank A at rate of 5 gal/s. There is a drain at the bottom of                       tank A. The solution leaves tank A via the drain at a rate of 5 gal/s and flows immediately into                       tank B at the same rate. A drain at the bottom of tank B allows the solution to leave tank B at a                       rate of 2.5 gal/s. What is the salt content in tank B at the precise moment that tank B contains                       250 gal of solution?                   2.   A tank contains 100 gal of pure water. At time zero, a sugar-water solution containing 0.2 lb.                       of sugar per gal enters the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min. Simultaneously, a drain is opened at the                       bottom of the tank allowing the sugar solution to leave the tank at 3 gal/min. Assume that the                       solution in the tank is kept perfectly mixed at all times.                         a)  What will be the sugar content in the tank after 20 minutes?                         b)  How long will it take the sugar content in the tank to reach 15 lbs.?                         c)  What will be the eventual sugar content in the tank?                   3.   A tank initially contains 50 gal of sugar water having a concentration of 2 lb. of sugar for each                       gal of water. At time zero, pure water begins pouring into the tank at a rate of 2 gal per minute.                       Simultaneously, a drain is opened at the bottom of the tank so that the volume of sugar-water                       solution in the tank remains constant.                         a)  How much sugar is in the tank after 10 minutes?                         b)  How long will it take the sugar content in the tank to dip below 20 lbs.?                         c)  What will be the eventual sugar content in the tank?                   4.

Salt-water solution containing 0.5 lb. of                       salt for each gallon of water begins entering the tank at a rate of 4 gal/min. simultaneously; a                       drain is opened at the bottom of the tank, allowing the salt-water solution to leave the tank at a                       rate of 2 gal/min. What is the salt content (lb.) in the tank at the precise moment that the tank is                       full of salt-water solution?                   5.   A tank contains 500 gal of a salt-water solution containing 0.05 lb. of salt per gallon of water.                       Pure water is poured into the tank and a drain at the bottom of the tank is adjusted so as to keep                       the volume of solution in the tank constant. At what rate (gal/min) should the water be poured                       into the tank to lower the salt concentration to 0.01 lb./gal of water in less than one hour?                   6.   Suppose that a large tank initially holds 300 gallons of water in which 50 pounds of salt have                       been dissolved.

What will be the number of cells of the end of 5                       days?                   4.   A biologist prepares a culture. After 1 day of growth, the biologist counts 1000 cells. After                       2days, he counts 3000. Assuming a Malthusian model, what the reproductive rate and how many                       cells were present initially?                   5.   A population of bacteria is growing according to the Malthusian model. If the population is                       triples in 10 hrs., what is the reproduction rate? How often does the population double itself?                   6.

Suppose that fishing is started in                       this lake and that 100 fish are removed each day.                       a)  Modify the logistic model to account for the fishing.                       b)  Find and classify the equilibrium points for your model.                       c)  Use qualitative analysis to completely discuss the fate of the fish population with this model.                           In particular, if the initial fish population is 1000, what happens to the fish as time passes?                           What will happen to an initial population having 2000 fish?                   7.   Suppose that in 1885 the population of a certain country was 50 million and was growing at the                       rate of 750,000 people per year at that time. Suppose also that in 1940 its population was 100                       million and was then growing at the rate of 1 million per year. Assume that this population                       satisfies the logistic equation. Determine both the limiting population  M  and the predicted                       population for the year 2000.                   8.   The time rate of change of a rabbit population P is proportional to the square root of P. At time                        t =  0  (months) the population numbers 100 rabbits and is increasing at the rate of 20 rabbits per                       month.

The time rate of change of an alligator population P in a swamp is proportional to the square of                  P.

Suppose that we have an artifact, say a piece of fossilized wood, and measurements show that                       the ratio of C−14 to carbon in the sample is 37% of the current ratio. Let us assume that the                       wood died at time 0, then compute the time T it would take for one gram of the radioactive                       carbon to decay this amount.                   26.  A certain radioactive material is known to decay at a rate proportional to the amount present. If                       initially there is 50  mg  of the material present and after of its original mass, find                         a)  An expression for the mass of the material remaining at any time t.                         b)  The mass of the material after 4 hours                         c)  The time at which the material has decayed to one half of its initial mass.                   27.  The rate at which radioactive nuclei decay is proportional to the number of such nuclei that are                       present in given sample. Half of the original number of radioactive nuclei have undergone                       disintegration in a period of 1,500 years.                         a)  What percentage of the original radioactive nuclei will remain after 4,500 years?                         b)  In how many years will only one-tenth of the original number remain?","","Section 1.8 – Basic Electrical Circuit                      An electric circuit is a path in which electrons from a voltage or current source flow. The point                  where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the \"source\" of electrons.                   Please refer to Appendix C for more detail about electric definitions’                    1.8-1  Resistor: (Ohm’s Law)                   A resistor is a component of a circuit that resists the flow of electrical current. It has two terminals                  across which electricity must pass, and it is designed to drop the voltage of the current as it flows                  from one terminal to the other. Resistors are primarily used to create and maintain known safe currents                  within electrical components.                   A voltage  ()Vt  across the terminals of a resistor is proportional to the current  ()It  in it. The constant                  proportional R is called the resistance of the resistor in Volt/Ampere or Ohms (Ω), and is given by                  the equation:                                 For series resistors, the equivalent resistor is:                                                    Then:   R   =  R +  R +     R+                                                        eq    1    2          n                          For resistors in parallels:                                                          Then:    1  =  1  +  1  +    +  1                                                      R      R    R          R                                                        eq    1     2          n","136 | 1. 8 - B as i c  E l e ct r i c al  C i r cu i t               1.8-2  Inductor: (Faraday’s Law)            When a current in a circuit is changing, then the magnetic flux is linking the same circuit changes.             This change in flux causes an emf v to be induced in the circuit.              Inductance is symbolized by letter L, is measured in henrys (H), and is represented graphically as            a coiled wire – a reminder that inductance is a consequence of a conductor linking a magnetic field.

The farad is an extremely large quantity of capacitance, practical capacitor values usually lie in the                  picofarad (pF) to microfarad (µF) range.                   The graphic symbol  for a capacitor  is a reminder that capacitance  occurs whenever electrical                  conductors are separated by a dielectric, or insulating, material. This condition implies that electric                  charge is not transported through the capacitor. Although applying a voltage to the terminals of the                  capacitor cannot move a charge through the dielectric, it can displace a charge within the dielectric.                  As the voltage varies with time, the displacement of charge also varies with time, causing what is                  known as the displacement current.                  The potential v between the terminals of a capacitor is proportional to the charge q on it.

In symbols, that is                                          F =  kx                    The constant k, measured in force units per unit length, is a characteristic of the spring, called the force                  constant (or spring constant) of the spring.                   The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke.","170 | 2. 1 - D e f i ni t i on s  o f  S e c on d  a nd  H i gh e r  O r d e r  E qu a t i on s                                                                             0                                                                     0                To stretch the spring to a position  x > , a force  F >   (in the positive direction) is required.                                                                            0                                                            0                To compress the spring to a position  x < , a force  F <    (in the  negative  direction) is                  required.                           2                       m                  1 kg ./ s =  1 N      (Newton                                            )             Example 1             A 4-kg weight is suspended from a spring.

A steady-state motion or current is one that is not transient and does not become unbounded.                  Free damped systems always yield transient motions, while forced damped systems (assuming the                  external force to be sinusoidal) yield both transient and steady-state motions.

Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)                  with a given initial value. It is the most basic kind of explicit method for numerical integration of                  ordinary differential equations.

For most equations and systems, it is                  suitably fast, simple, and accurate. It is generally referred to as “RK4”.                  It is the best for numerical solution of differential equations when combined with an intelligent                  adaptive step-size routine.

Pierre-Simon Laplace was a                  French astronomer and mathematician, he introduced Laplace transform                  to differential equation in 1979.                   Laplace transforms are restricted to functions of t and transform a                  function of a complex variable s. The Laplace operator will transform a                  linear differential equation with constant coefficients into an algebraic                  equation in the transformed function.

The growth rate of species is depending on their population.

The predator-prey system or model is based on the population Law of Mass Action.           The Law of Mass Action is defined as:                   “The rate of change of one population due to interaction of another is proportional to the                  product of the two populations.”","3. 5 - I nt r o du c t i on \&  B a s i c   T h e or y o f   L i n e a r  S ys t e m s  | 329                                                                             5                                                                             4                         4                                                                           3                        3                                                                           2                        2                                                                            1                        1                                    1        2        3       4                     1      2      3      4     5                                       (a)                                         (b) Flow direction.                                                                 x   xy                                                               x = −                                                                                                                                                                                              y                                                              y = −+  xy                                                      Where  ()xt  is the prey,    () t is the predator.                                                                             y                    3.5-3  Definition                    A linear system  of differential equations  is any  set of differential equations having the following                  standard form:                                  x′ =  a  () tx +  +  a  () tx +  f  () t                                  1    11   1        1n     n   1                                 x′ =  a  () tx +  +  a  () tx +  f  () t                                  2    21    1        2n    n     2                                                                                                                                  x′ =  a  () tx +  +  a  () tx +  f  () t                                  n     1 n  1        nn    n    n                                                                                                      ()                  Where  x  , , and x   are the unknown  functions.

Two tanks, each containing 360 liters of a salt solution. Pure water pours into tank A at a rate of                5 L/min. There are two pipes connecting tank A to tank B. The first pumps salt solution from tank                B into tank A at a rate of 4 L/min. The second pumps salt solution from tank A into tank B at a                rate of 9 L/min. Finally, there is a drain on tank B from which salt solution drains at a rate of 5                L/min. Thus, each tank maintains a constant volume of 360 liters of salt solution. Initially, there                are 60 kg of salt present in tank A, but tank B contains pure water.                                      a)  Set up, in matrix-vector form, an initial value problem that models the salt content in each                       tank over time.                    b)  Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix in part (a), then find the                       general solution in vector form. Find the solution that satisfies the initial conditions posed                       in part (a).                    c)  Plot each component of your solution in part (b) over a period of four-time constants                          0, 4 T    .

Ordinarily, this                is an open interval                                                                           +                                                                      x                                                                −                                              xa <    R   or a R < <     a R                                                −            2.  If the interval of absolute convergence  is  finite, test for convergence or divergence at each                endpoint. Use the Comparison Test, the Integral Test, or the Alternating Series Test.             3.  If the interval of absolute convergence is aR < < +                                   >  R  (it                                                          −                                                                x a R , the series diverges for  xa−                does not even converge conditionally) because the nth term does not approach zero for those                values of x.

For a practical application, we now consider the problem of determining when a uniform vertical                column will buckle under its own weight (after, perhaps, being nudged laterally just a bit by a                passing breeze). We take  x =  at the free top end of the column and  x =  L >  0  at its bottom; we                                             0                assume that the bottom is rigidly imbedded in the ground, perhaps in concrete.                                    Denote the angular deflection of the column at  the point  x  by  ( ) xθ  .

DC − circuits are the circuits where the voltage (current) is constant in time. Capacitor is an open                       circuit, like it’s not there                   Transient: A circuit changes from one DC configuration to another DC configuration (a source value                             changes or a switch flips).                              Determine the DC state (current, voltages, etc.) before the change.                             Then determine what happens after the change. Over time, the circuit will settle into a new                             DC state, where the capacitors are again open-circuits.                             In between will be an interval during which currents and voltages are changing as the                             capacitors charge or discharges. Since these lasts for only a short time, this is known as a                             transient effect.                   AC − circuits are circuits where the voltage (current) varies with time typically like a sine and                         cosine. Currents and voltage are changing continuously, sop capacitors are charging and                        discharging continuously.                   A source is a device that converts non-electrical energy to electrical energy are a battery which                  converts chemical energy to electrical energy and a generator which converts mechanical energy to                  electrical energy.

A typical ac signal may be given as                                                      =                                                   vV    sin ( tω  β +  )              v is the voltage at a given instant of time and is called instantaneous voltage.               V is the maximum value of the voltage and is called the amplitude of the voltage.               ω is the number of radians executed per second and is called the angular frequency of the              voltage.            It is related with               Frequency (f) as ω = 2πf              Period (T) as ω = 2π ⁄ T.               β is called the phase angle of the voltage.            Its effect is to shift the graph of sin ω  either to the right (if negative) or to the left (if negative).

The one with a bigger phase angle is said to be leading the other and the one with a smaller phase           angle is said to be lagging from the other.

Drift Velocity of Electrons                   Normally the electrons are normally colliding with each other. If there is no electric field, the net                  velocity of the electrons with zero. But if there is a net electric field, the electrons will have a net                  velocity opposite to the directions of the electrons. This velocity is called the drift velocity of                  electrons. Even though the carriers of charges are negative charges (electrons), conventionally it is                  assumed that the carriers of charge are positive charges.                   Thus, the direction of current density is taken to be the direction of movement of positive charges                  which is the same as the directions of the electric field.","472 |  A ppe nd i x   C             Consider carriers of charge of charge q crossing a cross-sectional area with a drift velocity V .                                                                                                    d                                                                        (         ∆ x )                                                                        ie           Suppose the charges travel a distance Δx in a time interval Δt.   ..

Parallel Plate Capacitor","A pp e ndi x   C  | 477                    Two parallel plates separated by an insulator. From symmetry, the electric field is uniform and                  perpendicular to the plate inside (between) the plates and approximately zero outside the plates.                  If the charge density is δ, an expression for the electric field can be obtained by using Gauss’s law by                  taking the Gaussian surface to be the cylindrical surface shown.                                The electric flux crossing part of the cylinder outside the plates is zero because the electric field                  outside the plates is approximately zero. The electric flux on the curved surface inside plates is zero                  because the area vector and the electric field perpendicular to each other. The only contribution to the                  electric flux comes from the end face inside the plates. If the area of the end face is A then                                                        ∫  E dA = ⋅    EA                    where is the magnitude of the electric field inside.

A dielectric is used to           increase the capacitance of a capacitor consider the parallel plate capacitor shown                             The charges in the plates of the capacitor will set up an electric field directed from the positive plate           towards the negative plate. Let the strength of this field be  E .                                                                     0            This is also the field between the capacitors when the plates are separated by vacuum (or air). This           electric field will exert force on the modules of the dielectric. The negative part of a molecule will be           pulled towards the positive plate and the positive part of the molecule will be pulled towards the           negative plate.            Thus, the molecules of the dielectric will set up their own electric field directed from their positive           end towards their negative and which is opposite to the electric field set up by the charges on the           plates. The net electric field between the plates is the field due to the charges in the plates minus the           field due to the molecules of the dielectric.           Thus, the electric field strength with a dielectric is less than the field strength without a dielectric.

The circuit symbol for an inductor is               When an inductor is connected to a source, current will flow through it and this current will produce           magnetic field inside the coil. That is there is magnetic flux crossing the loops of the coil due to its           own magnetic field.            If the current changes with time, then the magnetic field inside the coil will change with time which           implies the magnetic flux crossing the coil will change with time. According to Faraday’s law, this           change in magnetic flux will produce induced  mfε   in the coil. This kind of induced  mfε   is called           self induced  mfε   because it is caused by the current in the coil itself.                                         ε           Self-induced  mf  is directly proportional to the rate of change of current in the coil. The constant of           proportional between the self induced  mfε   and the rate of change of current in the coil is called            inductance (L) of the coil.                          ε     = − L  dI                           self      dt               ε    → self induced  mfε                self              L → Inductance  dI  , rate of change of current with time.                               dt           The negative sign indicates that the polarity of the self-induced  mfε   is in such a way aas to oppose            the cause for the change in flux which is the rate of change of current with time.

Determine the DC voltages on the capacitors before the change occurs. These may be given, or                     you may have to solve for them from the original configuration.                                                                     0                  2.  Let the change occur instantaneously at time t = . The capacitors will maintain their voltages                     into the instant just after the change. (Recall: capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously.)                    3.
