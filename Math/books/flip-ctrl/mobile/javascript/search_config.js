In aerospace, the control of aircraft, missiles, and satellites is an area of often very advanced                  systems. In the area nuclear work, control systems are not necessary. Technological development                  makes it possible travel to outer space and other planets. Space vehicles depend on the proper                  functioning of a large number of control systems.                     1.2  Control Systems: (Definitions)                      1.2.1. System: is an arrangement of physical components connected or related in such a manner as                         to form and/or act as entire unit. (A combination of components that act together.)                          Control is usually taken to mean regulate direct, or command.                      1.2.2. Control system: is an arrangement of physical component connected or related in such a                         manner as to command, direct or regulates itself or another system.                      1.3  Introduction To Control Systems                       1.3.1.   Assume that toaster timer is set for desired darkness of the toasted bread. The setting of                         the \"darkness\" represents the input quantity, but for the output is been the degree of darkness                         of  the  toast  produced.  If  the  bread  is  not  toasted  enough  (degree  of  darkness),  is  not                         satisfactory, so the output quantity has no influence on the input quantity. The heater portion                         of the toaster, excluding the timer unit, represents the feed-forward (or dynamic unit) of the                         overall system.                      1.3.2.  D-c shunt motor: For a given value of field current and voltage is applied to produce the                         desired value of motor speed in this case, the motor is the feed-forward part of the system, the","2     I N T R O D U C T I O N                     applied voltage is the input, and the speed is the output. A variation from the desired value of                    the speed due to a change of mechanical load on the shaft in this example, the output has no                    influence on the input.                             The  systems in  which the  output has no effect upon the  input are called  Open loop                            control system.                                    When the output has a feedback and is compared with the input, any necessary change                            is then made to cause the output to equal the desired value. The feedback action has                            controlled the input to the feed-forward. Thus systems in which the output has an                            effect upon the input called closed-loop control systems.                            1.4  Definitions                   Input system: It's the actual signal input to the control system.                   Output system: is the actual response obtained from a control system, where the quantity that                   must be maintained at a prescribed value.                   Feed-forward (dynamic unit): The unit that reacts to an actuating signal to produce a desired                   output. The job of the feed-forward is to control the output and play the power amplifier.                   Feedback system: Provides the output to be compared with the input to the system.                   Open-loop: A system in which the control is independent of the output.                   Closed-loop: A system in which the control is dependent on the output.","I N T R O D U C T I O N     3                   Example 1:                           Human being acts as a feedback control system. (as shown below)                                                            Fig 1- A pictorial demonstration of a human being acting as a  feedback control system.                          The action of a human being in walking from a starting point to a destination point along a                     prescribed path satisfies the definition of a feedback control system. The prescribed path is the                     input.  The  eyes  perform  the  function  of  comparing  the  actual  path  of  movement  with  the                     prescribed path, the desired output. The eyes transmit a signal to the brain, which amplifies this                     signal and transmits a signal to the legs to correct the actual path of movement to bring it in line                     with the desired path. From the beginning of the existence of the human race there has existed a                     feedback control system.                      Example 2:                       Consider the problem of trying to balance a broomstick in the palm of the hand.                     If  the hand is held stationary,  small disturbance  will cause  the broom to fall.                     But  if  one  knows  exactly  what  disturbances  will  occur  and  can  control  the                     motion of one's hand perfectly. It is possible to  determine in  advance how to                     move the hand   to balance the broom.  However, by always moving the hand in                     the direction  in which  the broom is falling,  it can be balanced. This of course                     requires feedback to sense the direction in which the broom is falling.","4     I N T R O D U C T I O N               Example 3:                       Opening temple doors as open-loop system.                  One of the earliest open-loop systems, Hero's device for opening the doors of a temple in the first              century was created.                                                                           Fig 2- Hero's device for opening temple doors.                      The command input to the system was the lighting of the fire upon the altar. The expanding                 air (hot) under the fire drove the water from the container into the bucket. As the bucket became                 heavier, it  descended  and  turned  the  door  sapodillas  by  means  of  a  rope,  causing  the  counter                 weight to rise. Dousing the fire could close the door. As the air in the container cooled and the                 pressure  was  thereby  reduced,  the  water  from  the  bucket  siphoned  back  into  the  storage                 container. Thus the bucket became lighter and the counter weight, being heavier, moved down,                 thereby closing the door. This occurs as long as the bucket is higher than the container.                   Example 4:                      Controlling the trajectory of a rocket.                  The direction of the thrust of the rocket is used  to correct for              changes in aerodynamic forces and wind disturbances that would              otherwise cause rocket to deviate from its course. Again feedback              is  important,  because  these  forces  and  disturbances  are  never              precisely known in advance.","I N T R O D U C T I O N     5                   Example 5:                           Historically, the  first automatic control device  used  in  the                     industry was the Watt fly-ball governor, discovered in 1767 by                     James Watt.                          The two fly balls in the governor rotate about a vertical axis                     at a speed proportional to the speed of the engine. Due to the                     centrifugal force acting on them,                  they tend to move. This movement controls the supply of steam to the engine through a mechanical                  linkage to the steam flow valve in such a manner that the steam supply is reduced when the speed is                  high and increased when the speed is low. If one tried to increase the sensitivity of the governor by                  increasing the gear ratio between the engine shaft and the governor, it tended to 'hunt' or oscillate                  about the desired setting.                     Example 6:                                 Antiaircraft radar tracking control system                         An  example  of  a  military  application  of a  feedback  control  system  is  the  antiaircraft  radar                  tracking control system. The radar antenna detects the position and velocity of the target airplane, and the                  computer circuit takes this information and determines the correct firing angle for the gun. This angle                  includes the necessary lead angle so that the shell reaches the projected position at the same time as the                  airplane.                                                                          Fig 3- Antiaircraft radar tracking control system.                      The output signal of the computer, a function of the firing angle, is fed into a power amplifier whose                  output voltage is applied to the drive motor. The motor then tilts the gun to the desired firing angle. A                  feedback signal proportional to the gun position assures correct alignment with the position determined by                  the computer. The gun must be positioned both horizontally and vertically. Therefore this system has two                  drive motors that are parts of two separate feedback loops.","CHAPTER   TWO                    MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION                     2.1  Introduction                  The studies of control systems rely to a great extent on the use of applied mathematics. A property              common to all basic of physics is that certain fundamental quantities can be defined by numerical              values.                 2.2  Complex Variable                  A complex number is a number of the form z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers and i or j                                                                            2              is so-called imaginary unit whose existence is postulated such that  i = 1.                      The real number x is called the real component or real part of z (Re(z)).                      The real number y is called the imaginary component or imaginary part of z                      (I(z) or Im(z))                                z  =  Re(z) + j Im(z)                                        (2-1)                  If two complex numbers differ only in the sign of their imaginary parts, either one is said to be the                                                          *              conjugate of the other and is usually written as z                                             *                     or   if   z = x + jy      z  = x - jy                                  (2-2)                  Addition and Subtraction:  z  = a + jb and z  = c + jd                                                             2                                              1                             z  - z  = (a - c)+j(b - d)                                       (2-3)                             1                                 2                  Multiplication:  In multiplication, all powers of i are to be reduced.                          2                                i =  1                          3                                i =  i                                 i  = i  i  = 1                             2 2                         4                    Division: of complex is defined as the inverse of multiplication","M A T H E M A T I C A L   F O U N D A T I O N     7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              a ib    a ib c id    ac bd   i   bc ad                       (2-4)                                                                                                                                                  c id    c id    c id    c   2  d 2  c   2  d 2                     Geometric/Trigonometric representation:                           z = x+iy = r(cos + isin) = rcis                                     (2-5)                                        2                         Where   r   x   y 2 ;   tan  1 -     y                                                             x                      2.3  Differential Equation                          A large class of systems and phenomena in engineering which are most formulated of physical                  laws is differential equations.                      2.4  Linear Differential Equation                          A linear differential equation is a differential equation consisting of a sum linear terms where one                  which is first degree in the dependent variables and their derivatives.                      Ohm's law states that if a voltage v is applied across a resistor R units then the current i through                  the resistor is related to v by the equation:  V = Ri.                      For instance, a series electrical RLC (Resistance (R) – Inductance (L) – Capacitance (C)) network                  can be represented by differential equation:                                             di ( ) t  1                                                                                                                         Ri ( ) t    L         i ( ) t dt      v ( ) t                        (2-6)                                            dt      C                      Similarly, for the scalar version of Newton's second-law states that if a force of magnitude f is                  applied to a mass of M units then the acceleration of the mass is related to f by the equation:     f =                  Ma.

Let                  consider the following set of n simultaneous algebraic equations:                                        a x  + a x  + ...  + a x   = y 1                                        11 1                                                             1n n                                                12 2                                        a x  + a x  + ...  + a x   = y 2                                        21 1                                                22 2                                                             2n n                                            :          :                      :          :                                            :          :                      :            :                                       a x  + a x  + ...  + a x   = y                                                                      n                                                              nn n                                        n1 1                                                n2 2                      We may simplify to Ax = y ; A, x, and y are defined as matrices.

The block diagram of a multivariable feedback control system is given by:                            The transfer function relationship between the input and the output of the system is obtained by              using matrix algebra.                             C(s) = G(s)E(s)                            E(s) = R(s) - B(s)                             B(s) = H(s)C(s)               Where C(s) is the mx1 output vector, E(s), R(s) and B(s) are all nx1 vectors and G(s) and H(s) are              mxn and nxm transfer function matrices, respectively.

It should be mentioned that although the development of the input-output relationship here is              similar to that of the single input-output case, in the present situation, it’s improper to speak of the              ratio C/R since C and R are matrices. However, it’s still possible to define the closed-loop transfer              matrix as:                                                 -1                            M(s) = [I + G(s)H(s)]  G(s)                                      (3-7)                             C(s) = M(s) R(s)                                                 (3-8)","B L O C K   D I A G R A M ,   S I G N A L   F L O W ,   A N D   S T A T E   D I A G R A M  3 9                   Example 3.8-1:                           Consider  that  the  forward-path  transfer  function  matrix  and  the  feedback-path  transfer                     function of the system:                                                 1      1                 1    0                                                s                                       G(s) =   1      s    , and    H(s) =                                                     2     1                   0  1                                                      s    2                          The closed-loop transfer matrix of the system is given by eq.3.7 and is evaluated as follows:                                                     2      1                                                      s                                                    s                                                    1      s                                         I+GH(s) =                                                     2    s  3                                                           s    2                      The closed-loop transfer matrix is:                                     s   3  1     1    1                                                    1                         M(s) =   1        s   s         s   ,                                       2  s  2    2  1                                            s     1    s     2                                                   2                      where       s   2  s   3    2    s   s 5  2                                  s  1  s   2  s  s ( s   ) 1                                                s 3  2   s 9   4  1                                        s ( s   ) 1    s ( s   )( s  ) 2    s                                                     1                     Thus: M(s) =                                                                      s 2   s 5   2    2       s 3   2                                                                s ( s   ) 1                       3.8  Analytical Method                                       x  = T R + T C                       2                            12                                    42                     x  = T x  + T R                                    13                            23 2                       3                     C = T x  + T C                           34 3                                    44                   Find C/R?","4 0  B L O C K   D I A G R A M ,   S I G N A L   F L O W ,   A N D   S T A T E   D I A G R A M                     C    T 12 T 23 T 34  T     13 T 34                                       (3-9)                  R      1  T (     23 T 34 T 42   T 44 )                                          P 1   T 12 T 23 T 34                     Path   transmitta  nce                                              P                                          2   T 13 T 34                                           l 1   T 23 T 34 T 42                     Loop   transmitta nce                                               l                                           2   T 44","B L O C K   D I A G R A M ,   S I G N A L   F L O W ,   A N D   S T A T E   D I A G R A M  4 1                   Signal Flow Graph Method                      3.9  Introduction                       These  are  two  concepts  to  the  feedback  system  analysis.  The  first  is  the  circuit  concept  the                  visualization of combination of physical components. The second is the block-diagram approach to                  the analysis of complex systems.                      A signal flow graph is a graphic representation of the simultaneous equations describing a system.                  It graphically displays the transmission of signals through the system, as does the block diagram.                    3.10 The Signal - Flow Diagram                       The block diagram is useful tool for simplifying the representation of a system. When a system                  has more than one input and one output, the control system and block diagram are more complex. An                  analysis  can  be  further  simplified  by  using  a  signal  flow  graph,  which  has  the  appearance  of  a                  simplified block diagram.                      A signal flow graph is a diagram, which represents a set of simultaneous equations. It consists of a                  network in which nodes, represented by a small dot, are connected by directed branches, represented                  by a line with an arrow.                           The simple equation for this signal flow graph is x  = T x . The variables x  and x  can be                                                                                                         2                                                                                                 1                                                                       2                                                                             12 1                  functions of time, complex frequency, or any other quantity. The branch transmits the signal x  from                                                                                                           1                  left to right and multiplies it by the quantity T  in the process. The quantity T  is the transmittance,                                                             12                                                                                           12                  or transfer function and where the subscripts show that the signal-flow is from node 1 to node 2.                      A node, and every transmission function designate every variable in signal flow graph by a branch.                  Branches are always unidirectional; the arrow denotes the direction of signal flow.                   A node performs into three functions:                      1- The addition rule: Addition of the signals on all incoming branches. The value of the variable                     designated  by a node  is equal  to the  sum of all  signals entering the  node. In other words the                     equation:                                         X i     ij x                                                T                                                    j                       2- Transmission rule: of the total node signal (the sum of all incoming signals) to all outgoing                     branches. In another meaning, the value of the variable designated by a node is transmitted on                     every branch leaving that node.","4 2  B L O C K   D I A G R A M ,   S I G N A L   F L O W ,   A N D   S T A T E   D I A G R A M                                       X  = A x                                          ik  k                                     I                   3- The multiplication rule: A cascaded (series) connection of n-1 branches with transmission                 functions T T T      ...

Algebraic sum of two or more variables:  The algebraic sum of two or more machine variables                     may be obtained by means of the operational amplifier.

One is that the input              signals to these systems are in the form of pulse trains, and the dynamics of the system or process are              identical to those that operate analog signals. For instance, a dc motor can be controlled either by a              controller that puts out analog signals or by a digital controller that sends out digital commands. In              the latter case an interface such as digital-to-analog converter (D/A) is necessary to couple the digital              component to analog devices.                                                Fig 3.14-1: Block diagram of a discrete-data system.                   In this case, an ideal sampler with a sampling period T models the digital operation. The output of              the ideal sampler is a train of impulses. The data hold acts as an interface or filter which converts the              impulses into an analog signal. One of the most commonly used data holds in practice is the zero-              order hold (z.o.h). Functionally,  the  z.o.h  simply holds the  magnitude  of the signal  carried by  the              impulse  function  at  a  given  time  instant,  say  kT,  for  the  entire  sampling  period  T,  until  the  next              impulse arrive at t = (k+1)T. Analytically, the z.o.h is also used to model the operations of a D/A.                               (a) Input signal to ideal sample.

Fig 3.14-2                      Arrows, since by definition they have zero pulse with and infinite height represent the impulses.                  The lengths of the arrows represent the strengths of or areas under the impulses. The output of the                  z.o.h is a staircase approximation of the input signal r(t). It's easy to see that h(t) approaches r(t) as the                  sampling period T approaches zero; that is,                                         lim     ) t ( h    ) t ( r                              (3-15)                                        T 0                      However, the limit of r*(t), the impulse train, as T approaches zero does not have any physical                  meaning, and                                 lim  r *  ) t (    ) t ( r                                     (3-16)                                 T 0                      Another situation often encountered in a discrete-data or digital control system is that the process                  receives  discrete  or  digital  data  and  sends  out  signals  in  the  same  form,  such  as  in  the  case  of  a                  microcomputer. The block diagram shows below representation of this type of system.                                                    Fig 3.14-3: Block diagram of a digital process                      These are several way of deriving the transfer function representation of the system of Fig 3.15-1.                  The following derivation is based on the Fourier series representation of the input r*(t). We can begin                  by writing:                                     r*(t) = r(t) (t)                                            (3-17)                   Where  (t) is the input impulse train:    (t) =  (t - kT)                  (3-18)                                                            T                          T                      Since   is a periodic function, with period T, it can be expressed as a Fourier series.

Example 3.14-A:                              Vertical Indicator:                       A  vertical  indicator  is  the  inertial  space  integrator  (stabilized  platform)  adding  to  it  an                  accelerometer with its axis horizontal and perpendicular to the input axis. A vertical indicator shows                  the  true  vertical  position  with  respect  to  the  earth  (the  direction  of  gravity),  independent  of  the                  location and attitude of the box.                                                                     Fig 3.A-1:  Single-degree of freedom vertical indicator.                     When the stabilized platform is displayed from the true horizontal by an angle  table  , there is a                  component  gravitational  acceleration,  g.sin ,  along  the  sensitive  axis  of  the  accelerometer.  The                                                            t                  accelerometer produces a signal e  that is proportional to the acceleration along its sensitive axis. The                                                 ac                  signal e  is integrated, producing a signal   that is applied to the integrating gyro on the stabilized                                                            c                         ac                  platform. This signal changes the reference axis of the integrating gyro, resulting in a rotation of the                  table when the table reaches a horizontal position, the signal e  becomes zero and the table stops.                                                                              ac                  The table therefore maintains a horizontal orientation (perpendicular to the direction of gravity). Even                  though  the  orientation  of  the  base  may  change.  Additional  refinements  are  omitted  from  this                  description for the purpose of simplicity.

The  target  may  be  an  enemy  bomber  whose  aim  is  to  drop  bombs  at  some  position.  The              defense  uses  the  missile  with  the  objective  of  intercepting  and  destroying  the  bomber  before  it              launches its bombs as is shown next page:                                                                 Fig 3.B-1:  Command guidance interceptor system.                  The target-tracking radar is used first for detection and then for tracking of the target. It supplies              information on target range \& angle, and their rates of change (time derivatives). This information is              continuously fed into the computer, which calculates a predicted course for the target. The missile-              tracking radar supplies similar information, which is used by the computer to determine its flight path.","B L O C K   D I A G R A M ,   S I G N A L   F L O W ,   A N D   S T A T E   D I A G R A M  5 3                   The computer compares the two flight paths and determines the necessary change in missile flight                  path  to  produce  a  collision  course.  The  necessary  flight-path  changes  are  supplies  to  the  radio                  command link, which transmits this information to the missile. The missile control system converts                  the error signals to mechanical displacements of the missile airframe control surfaces by means of                  motor drives. The missile responds to the positions of the aerodynamics control surfaces to follow                  the prescribed flight-path, which is intended to produce a collision with the target. Monitoring of the                  target is continuous so that changes in the missile course can be corrected up to the point of impact.

Spring-Mass-Damper system:                                           By Newton’s law, mx equals the resultant of all external forces on m in the downward                        direction. To help in determining the signs of the terms in such problems, it is useful to make                        any assumption concerning the motion  for example that the mass is moving downward from                        x = 0. In that case the spring is stretched, so spring force kx is upward, and hence opposes                        downward acceleration. It therefore receives a minus sign on the right side of the equation for                        mx. Since the mass moves down, the damping force cx is upward, and this term must also                        have a minus sign. The external force f(t) helps downward acceleration, and therefore has a                        plus minus. The resulting equation is:                                      mx = -kx-cx+f(t)   mx+cx+kx = f(t)                          (4-10)                            It may have been observed that the effects of gravity do not appear, so that turning the                        system  upside  down  will  not  affect  the  equation.  This  is  done  by  choosing  x  =  0    at  the                        position of static equilibrium.

The differential equation for both systems is:                              M  d  2 x   + D  dx   + kx = f(t)                                 dt 2      dt                    Taking  Laplace  transforms  of  both  sides,  assuming  zero  initial  conditions,  we  get  the               transfer function:                                      X  ) s (     1                              G  ) s (                                                  2                                        ) s ( F  Ms  Ds  K                 Example 4.3-3:                    A mechanical  system  with 2 coordinate movements and its equivalent electrical  circuit,               where k represents a spring and D  and D  represent dashpots.                                                      2                                               1","7 1                                        M E C H A N I C A L   T R A N S L A T I N G   \&   R O T A T I O N A L   S Y S T E M                           Solution:                                  The  equations  are  obtained  by  applying  Kirchhoff's  current  law  at  each  of  the  2                        ungrounded nodes.

The mechanical network for the gear train is:                                     At  each  gear  pair  two  torques  are  produced.  For  example,  a  restraining  torque  T   is                                                                                                            1                        produced on gear 1 by the rest of the gear train.

T   is  the  load  on  gear  1  produced  by  the  rest  of  the  gear  train.  T   is  the  torque                                                                                                 2                                 1                        transmitted  to  gear  2  to  drive  the  rest  of  the  gear  train.

The advantage of using the block diagram is  that is gives a clear picture of the transfer               function relation between each block of the system. Since an s can be factored out from the               denominator of Eq.4-38, the significance of the transfer function  (s)/E (s) is that the dc                                                                                      a                                                                                m               motor is essentially an integrating device between these two variables. This is expected, since if               e   is  a  constant  input,  the  output  motor  displacement  will  behave  as  the  output  of  an                a               integrator; that is, it will increase linearly with time.                    Although a dc motor by itself is basically an open-loop system., but the block diagram               show that the motor has a \"built-in\" feedback loop caused by the back-emf. Physically, the               back-emf represents the feedback of a signal that is proportional to the negative of the speed               of the motor. The back-emf constant k  represents an added term to the resistance R  and                                                                                                  a                                                     b               viscous-friction coefficient B .

The necessary and sufficient condition for a               system to be asymptotically stable is that all the elements of the first column of the Routh               array are the same sign. If there are changes of signs in the elements of the first column, the               number of sign changes indicates the number of roots with positive real parts.                What are the Routh array and the Routh algorithm?                                   5                            6                                         4                                                       2                                                3                   d(s) = a s  + a s  + a s  + a s  + a s  + a s + a  = 0                                                                 6                                 1                                                           5                          0                                                     4                                              3                                       2                                              2                                      4                               6                        m(s) = a s  + a s  + a s  + a                                    2                             0                                           4                                                  6                                      3                               5                        n(s) = a s  + a s  + a s                                          5                             1                                    3                    The  Routh-Hurwitz  criterion  is  a  method  for  determining  from  the  coefficients  of  the               characteristic equation the stability of the system.

Then the system is stable if and only if all the roots of the characteristic polynomial, (s), are               in the left half of the s-plane.                    Alternatively, the system is stable if and only if all the eigenvalues of A have negative real               parts.                    Instead of actually finding all the roots of (s), one may use the Routh-Hurwitz criterion               to determine the number of roots in the right half of the s-plane. Relative stability may be               investigated by shifting the axis.                 Example 5.6-1:                    The state equations for a third-order system are given below. Use the Routh criterion to               determine whether it is stable.                      y = [1  2  1]x                             0   1  8     2                                               x    1  0  5   +   x     1   u                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0   2  6    0                                                      The characteristic polynomial is obtained from:                                            s    1    8                                                                (s)= det (sI - A) =  1   s     5                                           0    2  s   6                                             2                                          = s(s +6s+10) + 1(-s-6) + 16                                                 2                                           3                                          = s  + 6s  + 9s + 10                The Routh table is as follows                    s 3  1  9                   s 2  6    10                    1  54 10        The system is stable.                   s    6                   s 0  10                 Example 5.6-2:                     The A matrix in the state equation for a helicopter near hover is given below.

The first thing we should determine about a given system                        whether it is stable. This can be obtained by obtaining the roots of the characteristic equation:                        1+GH(s)=0. By applying the Routh's criterion to the characteristic equation, it is possible to                        determine whether the system  is stable  or unstable.  But it does not indicate the degree  of                        stability  of  the  system.  The  graphical  methods  to  be  described  later  on  not  only  indicate                        whether  a  system  is  stable  or  unstable  but,  for  a  stable  system,  also  shows  the  degree  of                        stability.                            There are two basic methods to analyze and interpret the steady-state sinusoidal response                        of the system's transfer function to obtain an idea of the system's response. This method is                        based upon the interpretation of the system's Nyquist plot.                         The second is the root-locus method.                        The root-locus is a plot of the roots of the characteristic equation of the close-loop system as                        a function of the gain.                            Devised by Evan's, this is a graphical approach that yields a clear indication of the effect                        of gain adjustment with relatively small effort compared with other methods.

(6-4)                A locus of these roots plotted in the s-plane as a function of k is called a root-locus.

Example 6.4-1b: It's apparent that when k is very large, the equation can                                      be approximated by k(s+1) = 0    s = -1  zero.                            2- Real Root Branches:                    The total number of finite poles and zeros of GH determined the root locus on the real               axis in the s plane. Then the number of branches of the root locus is equal to the number of               the poles of the open-loop transfer function.                   Example 6.4-2a:  The number of the branches on the complete root loci of:                                                    s(s+2)(s+3)+k(s+1)=0  is three.                                     Since the equation is of the third order in s, it must have three roots,                                     and therefore 3 root loci.                3- Real axis loci:                    For k > 0, points of the root-locus on the real axis lie to the left of an odd number of               finite poles and zeros.                   For k < 0, points lie to the left of an even number of finite poles and zeros.                4- Center of gravity:","R O O T   L O C U S   T E C H N I Q U E     1 0 9                                                               i                                                            P    z i                                                     CG                                               (6-5)                                                          N   N z                                                             p                         The  branches  of  a  root  locus  approach  a  set  of  straight-line  asymptotes  these  asymptotes                        emanate from a point in the s-plane on the real axis called the center of gravity or center of                        asymptotes.                                       Pi : the summation of the poles = 0-2-3 = -5                                       z  : the summation of the zeros = -1                                         i                                        N  : Number of poles  = 3                                         p                                        N  : Number of zeros  = 1                                         z                                  Therefore:   CG = (-5+1)/2 = -2                         5- Asymptotic angle: Plotting of the locus is greatly facilitated if one can determine the                                      asymptotes approaches by the various branches as s takes on large values.                                               l 2 (    ) 1                                        1    N  N z   ; l = 0, 1, 2,...,N -N -1                  (6-6)                                                                            z                                                                         p                                              p                                              l 2 (     ) 1      o     2/                             And       l                                                                                                                 2                                                      1   3  2/                         6- Break away points: The locus starts at the poles where k = 0 and ends at zero (s = )                                     Case 1 - The locus has branches on the real axis between two    poles.                                  There must be a point at which the two ranches breakaway from the real axis and                                enter the complex region of the s-plane in order to approach zeros or the point at                                infinity. Then, there is a point s, for which the sensitivity k  is greater than for any                                                                                        z                                other point on either side of s, on the real axis. In other words, since k starts with a                                value of zero at the poles and increases in value as the locus moves away from the                                poles.  There  is  a  point  somewhere  in  between  where  the  k's  of  the  two  branches                                reach the maximum value. This point is called the breakaway point.                            Case 2- Case of two zeros, the branches are coming from poles in the complex region and                                enter the real axis.","1 1 0    R O O T   L O C U S   T E C H N I Q U E                                     Case 3 - The value of  for which the value k is a minimum between these 2 zeros               is called break-in point.

However, in many control system, the systems have several parameters. For example, when               designing a controller that is represented by  a transfer function  with poles and zeros, it is               necessary  to  investigate  the  effects  on  the  performance  of  the  overall  system.  When  these               poles and zeros take on various values.                    When more than one parameter varies continuously from - to +, the loci of the root               are referred to as the root contours. However all the root loci rules are still applicable to the               construction of the root contours.               The principle of the root contours can be illustrated by considering the equation:                                      Q(s) + k P(s) + k R(s) = 0                               (6-8)                                             1                                                     2                    Where k  and k  are the variable parameters and Q(s), P(s), and R(s) are polynomials of s.                                 2                          1                First step, let set k  equals to zero; then the equation becomes                                2                                      Q(s) + k P(s) = 0                                        (6-9)                                             1                                          K 1   ) s ( P                                     1 +         = 0                                          (6-10)                                          Q   ) s (                             or                                     1 + G (s)H (s) = 0                                       (6-11)                                               1                                          1                The construction of the root loci depends on the pole-zero configuration of                                                  K      ) s ( P                                                   1                                     G (s)H (s) =   Q  ) s (                                  (6-12)                                      1                                           1                Next, we restore the value of k , and get the equation                                            2                                             k     ) s ( R                                     1 +      2        = 0                                    (6-13)                                         Q   ) s (  k 1  ) s ( P","R O O T   L O C U S   T E C H N I Q U E     1 1 5                           This is in the form:                                              1 + G (s)H (s) = 0                                        (6-14)                                                        2                                                   2                         Now the root contours of Eq. (6-8) are constructed based upon the poles and zeros of:                                                               k  2  ) s ( R                                             G (s)H (s) =                                              (6-15)                                               2                                                    2                                                           Q  ) s (   k 1  ) s ( P                            However, one important feature is that the poles of G (s)H (s) are identical to the root of                                                                                   2                                                                              2                        Eq. (6-9) or of Eq. (6-11). Thus the root contours of the original equation must all start (k  =                                                                                                            2                        0) at the points that lie on the root loci of Eq.

The characteristic equation of the system can be written:                                                2                                      s(1+Ts)(s +2s+2)+k = 0                                           (6-17)                         First, we shall set T = 0.

Having the frequency response curves of a system permits analysis with respect to                        the curves; which permits the design of a pass-band for the system response that excludes the                        noise. It is also, in which the actual transfer functions of some or all of the blocks in a block                        diagram  are  not  known  analytically.

Gain and phase margins are often defined in terms of Bode plots.                          7.5  Terminology (Logarithmic Scales and Bode Plots)                         i- Minimal phase and non-minimal phase function:                            A minimal phase function is a function, which does not have any poles or zeros lying in                           the right-half s-plane.                                         10  s (  10 )                               G   ) s (                   Minimal    phase   function.                                        s ( s  5 )( s   ) 2                                        10  s (  10 )                               G   ) s (                  Non   Minimal    phase   function                                       s (   5 )( s   ) 2                         ii- Decibels:                            The unit commonly used in feedback-system work for the logarithm of the magnitude is                           the decibel. The term decibel as used originally in engineering referred to the ratio of two                           values of power. But recently it has been used for the ratio of two voltages. The ratio of                           two quantities in feedback system work is not necessarily dimensionless. Logarithms of                           transfer functions are used, where the transfer function is the ratio of output to input of a                           block. Logarithmic scales are used for Bode plots where  axes abscissas.

Relative  stability:  G G  must  have  adequate  length  of  not  more  than  a  -20  dB/dec                                          c               slope at or near crossover frequency  .                                                   c                From  fig.7.8-2,  if  other  break  frequencies  are  far  removed  from   ,  as  suggested  by  the                                                                                 c               dashed lines, (a), (b), and (c) approximate the functions and phase margins indicated. Thus, if               inspection of a Bode plot reveals little or no length of not more than a -20 db/dec slope at or               near  , it is immediately evident that   will be inadequate.                     c                                                    m                    2. Steady-state accuracy: To improve steady-state accuracy, the low-frequency asymptote               must be raised or its slope changed.","F R E Q U E N C Y   R E S P O N S E   A N A L Y S I S   \&   B O D E   P L O T   1 4 3                                                               n                        The low frequency asymptote is k/(j) . For n = 0(type 0) the steady-state error can be given                        by:                                                         sR  ) s (                                             e  =  lim                                                 (7-18)                                              ss                                                   s 0 1 G  ) s (                           After a unit step is 1/(1+k), so reduces if the zero slope low frequency asymptote 20 logk is                        raised.                        For type 1 (n=1), the low-frequency asymptote slope must be at least -20 db/dec. Steady-state                        errors for n = 1 and 2 reduce as k is increased, so as the low-frequency asymptotes are raised.                         This intersects the 0 db axis at  = k and  =  k , respectively.                                                                                                        n                           The  asymptotes  can  also  be  plotted  by  calculating  the  magnitude  of  k/(j)   at  any                        convenient value of , where k may be determined by a specification on steady-state errors.                        Say that the steady-state ramp following error 1/k (n = 1) may be 10 . Then 1/k = 0.1, so k                        = 10 and the db magnitude is 20 log(10/). At  = 0.1, this is 40  db, so the –20  db/dec                        asymptote must pass  = 0.1 at level of 40 db.                            3. Accuracy in the operating range: To ensure specified accuracy over a normal range                        of frequencies, the plot may not fall below a given level over this range. To improve accuracy,                        this level must be raised.                                                E      1                                                (7-19)                                              R   1  G c G                         If up 10  error is permitted up to a certain frequency,                                              G G  10 = 20 db                                        (7-20)                                                c                         is approximately the minimum allowed level up to this frequency. Thus the notion of accuracy                        is  extended  to  dynamic  operation.  Raising  low-frequency  asymptotes  not  only  improves                        steady-state accuracy but also that at other frequencies where this has raised the plot.                            4. Crossover frequency and bandwidth: Crossover frequency , is a   measure of                         bandwidth  , so of speed of response, according to    0.63                                     b                                                                                     b                                                                           c                         If G G >> 1, then:                             c                                               C     G c G    1                                       (7-21)                                              R    1 (  G c G )                         So output follows input almost perfectly.

Noise rejection: To ensure a specified attenuation (reduction) of noise components in               the input above a certain frequency, the plot above that frequency should be below a certain               level.                Noise at high frequencies, above the bandwidth, is often present in input signals. To cause the               system to act as a filter, it may be specified that noise amplitudes shall be reduced to 10                above a certain frequency. Sufficiently above the bandwidth, this requires that                                      C    G  G    1 . 0    20 db                          (7-23)                                     R      c                So  the plot must be  below  -20  dB. Noise  rejection considerations are one  reason why  the               bandwidth of a system should not be made larger than necessary.","F R E Q U E N C Y   R E S P O N S E   A N A L Y S I S   \&   B O D E   P L O T   1 4 5                                                          EXERCISES                            7.1   Draw the Bode plots (Magnitude and phase plots) for the following functions:                                             100   +   (s    10)                               a)  G       =   ) s (                                          s(s + 1)(1 +  0.01s)                                b)  G(s) =   100 e    -0.5 s                                           s (  1 )( s  10 )                                                +   (s  100)                               c)  G(s) =                                          s 2  s (   ) 1                                                10  s (   ) 5                               d)  G(s) =                                           1 ( s  10 s )( 1  . 0  01  ) s                                           10(s + 1)(s + 10)                               e)  G(s) =                                         (s + 0.1)(s + 100)                                f)  G(s) =      10     +   s  20   2                                          s 2  1   s   1   s                                                10     100                                              s ( s   20 )                               g)  G(s) =                                           2                                          s    s 4   2                                            s (  10 )( s  20 )                               h)  G(s) =                                           s (  1 )( s  200 )                                           100  s (   ) 1 . 0                               i)  G(s) =                                            2                                           s   s   4                                j)  G(s) =   100                                           2                                          s   s  1                                              s ( s  10 )                               k)  G(s) =                                           2                                          s    s 2  1                           7.2   The asymptotic log-modus curves for various functions are drawn as the following.

This method can only be                        used for stability for determining absolute stability, and is only applicable to systems whose                        characteristic equation is a finite polynomial in s.                            But  Nyquist,  a  frequency  response  method,  is  essentially  a  graphical  procedure  for                        determining  absolute  and  relative  stability  of  closed-loop  systems.  Which  is  applied  to  the                                                   -1                        poles  plot  of  G(j)    or    G (j).  The  Nyquist  method  handles  systems  with  time  delay                        without the necessity of approximations, and hence yields exact results about both absolute                        and relative stability of the system.                            The degree of stability can be readily ascertained by use of the (M-) circles. A correlation                        can be made from the sinusoidal response to the step time response for a signal applied to the                        system, which improve both the transient and the steady-state sinusoidal varying inputs can be                        determined from the same plot.                            We can conclude that the effect of the static error coefficients for various types of inputs                        makes the Nyquist's stability criterion a highly desirable method.                            8.2  Plotting Complex Functions of a Complex Variable                            A complex function of a complex variable is given by the transfer function G(s) with                                             s =  + j                                                (8-1)","1 5 2     N Y Q U I S T                   Where:  is the real variable and  is an imaginary.

The construction of the                        Nyquist plot of G(s) is outlined as follows from section (4):                                             j                                      s = Re                                                           (8-11)","1 6 0     N Y Q U I S T                                  lim  G  ) s (    10 k   e0   2j                             (8-12)                              s         s 2                    The Nyquist path is traversed from -90 to +90 through 180 counterclockwise, Eq.

In this               case it is necessary to determine the intersection of the G(s) plot on the imaginary axis. Setting               the real part of G(j) to zero in Eq. (8.6-5), we have:                                              4                                                    2                                              + 6  - 20 = 0                                 (8-15)                Where the roots are:      =  1.54 rad/sec                                      1,2                Therefore, the intersects on the real axis of the G(s)-plane are at                              G(j0) = 2k     and    G(j 10 ) = -k","N Y Q U I S T   1 6 1                           And the intersection on the imaginary axis is:  G(j1.54) = j5.43k                            The Nyquist plot for G(s) is sketched as shown in Fig. (8.6-4). The information on the                        imaginary  axis  is  needed  so  that  the  direction  of  section  (1)  may  be  determined  without                        actually plotting the locus point by point.                            Since Eq. (8-10) shows that G(s) has no zeros inside the right half of the plane, Z  = 0;                                                                                                          0                        this means that P  = 2, thus P= 2. Now, by applying the Nyquist criterion, we have:                                        0                                              N = Z - P = Z - 2                            Thus, for the closed-loop system to be stable, Z = 0, which requires that N = -2. The                        stability  criterion  requires  that  the  (-1,  j0)  point  must  be  encircled  twice  in  the  clockwise                        direction. In order words, the critical point should be to the right of the crossover point at -k.                         For the stability when k > 1:                                                                          Fig.8.6-4: Nyquist plot of G(s)=10k(s+2)/(s +3s +10)                                                                                      2                                                                                  3                         8.7  Relative Stability                                 The relative stability of a feedback control system is easily determined from the Polar                        or Nyquist stability plot.                            If a feedback amplifier is to be useful as an amplifier, it must be stable at all frequencies,                        including the particular range of frequencies at which it is to be used. Hence, it is necessary to                        look  at the magnitude  and phase  angle  of feedback-amplifier gain  for all  frequency. When","1 6 2     N Y Q U I S T                        e a               ratio   is expressed as a fact of a complex variable, it is called the voltage-transfer ratio, or                     e i               simply the transfer function.                    Two commonly used measures of relative in stability are the gain margin and the phase               margin.                   The  gain  margin  is  defined,  as  the  additional  gain  required  making  the  system  just               unstable. It may be expressed either as a factor or in decibels. The Phase margin is defined, as               the additional phase lag required making the system just unstable.                 Gain Margin.                       The gain margin is a measure of the closeness of the phase-crossover point to the (-                   1,j0) point in the G(s)H(s)-plane. The phase crossover frequency  is that frequency at                   which the phase angle of GH(j) is -180, that is, the frequency at which the polar plot                   crosses the negatives real axis.                    The gain margin is given by:                      Gain margin = G  =       1                                               (8-16)                                    m                                          GH   j (   )                    Where   GH(j)       = -180                                                           Example:                           GH(j) =    1    ;   GH(j) = -180 ,  b = 0.                                    a   jb                    Conditions:                                     G  > 1       Asymptotically stable.                                      m                                     G     1       Unstable.                                      m                             If      G  >> 1    Very stable.                                      m                                     G  << 1    Very unstable.                                      m","N Y Q U I S T   1 6 3                                                    Phase Margin                                The gain margin is merely one of the many ways of representing the relative stability                           of a feedback control system.

However, for a system  with multiple numbers of feedback loops, F(s) is a sum of                        several rational functions, the poles and the zeros of F(s) may be unknown. Thus, a systematic                        approach to the application of the Nyquist criterion to multi-loop control system is desirable.                            Let’s consider a multi-loop control system as shown in Fig. (8.8-1), the block diagram with                        two loops.","1 6 6     N Y Q U I S T                                                   Fig. 8.8-1:  Multi-loops feedback control system.                           ) s ( C    G 1  ) s (  G 2  ) s (                                ) s ( F                            ) s ( E   1   G 2  ) s (  H  ) s (                                         s ( k   ) 2                                                                                             (8-19)                               s (  10   s ( s )   1 )( s   ) 2    5                    Since the poles of F(s) are not entirely known, so we can break the problem in two steps,               as there are two feedback loops.

Since all the poles and zeros are found                        to be in the left half of the s-plane. We have to find out the crossover point of the F(s) locus                        with respect to the (-1, j0) point to determine the requirement on k for the overall system to                        be stable.

The               Nichols chart is essentially a transformation of the M and N circles on the polar plot into               noncircular M and N contours on a dB magnitude versus phase angle plot. The Nichols chart               plot has at least two advantages over the polar plot:                    1.  A much order range of magnitudes can be graphed because GH(j) is plotted on a                      logarithmic scale; and                    2.  The graph of GH(j) is obtained by algebraic summation of the individual magnitude                      and phase angle contributions of its poles and zeros.                While both of GH(j) and arg GH(j) are included on a single Nichols chart plot.                  8.11  M \& N Circles Definitions                       The closed-loop frequency response of a unity feedback control system is given by:                                                                                           C  ) s (  G  ) s (  G  j (  )    C  j (  )   Im C  / R                                                                    1                                                         tan                           (8-25)                                 G                       R  ) s (  1  (  ) s  1  ( j )    R  j (  )  Re  C  / R                                             G                    By drawing lines of constant magnitude, called M-circles and lines of constant phase angle,               called N-circles, directly onto the G(j)-phase when:                                             G  j (  )                                     M =                                                      (8-26)                                          1  G  j (  )                             and                                     N =   Im C  / R   tan tan  1  Im C  / R            (8-27)                                          Re C  / R            Re  C  / R                    The intersection of the polar plot with a particular N-circle yields the value of N at the               frequency  at the intersection.

To analyze the performance of the system, the best way is to have both the magnitude and               the phase of the closed loop frequency response. Working with the polar coordinates for the               G(j) plot, has a major disadvantage, is that the curve no longer retains its original shape.                    In the Bode diagram the magnitude curve is shifted up and down without distortion when               the loop gain is varied; in the magnitude-versus-phase plot, the entire G(j) curve is shifted up               or down vertically when the gain is altered. The constant M and constant N loci in the polar               coordinates may be transferred to the magnitude-versus-phase coordinates without difficulty.                    Given  a  point  on  a  constant  M  circle  in  the  G(j)-plane,  the  corresponding  point  in  the               magnitude -versus-phase plane may be determined by drawing a vector directly from the origin of               the G(j)-plane to the particular point on the constant M circle; the length of the vector in decibels               and the phase angle in degrees give the corresponding point in the magnitude-versus-phase plane.","N Y Q U I S T   1 7 3                                                                            (a) Constant M circles in the G(j)-plane.

In trying to improve the transient performance one may introduce in                        deterioration in the steady-state behavior and vise versa. The time response of a control                        system is usually divided into two parts: The transient response and the steady-state response.                        Let c(t) denotes a time response, then:                                              c(t) = c (t) + c (t)                                      (9-1)                                                            ss                                                     t                                Where c (t) = transient response.                                       t                                         c (t) = steady-state response.                                      ss                             In  general,  we  do  not  know  the  inputs  to  which  a  particular  control  system  will  be                        subjected  while  under  operation.  Hence,  for  the  purposes  of  analysis  and  design,  it's                        customary to consider the effect of the application of certain standard inputs, which subject                        the system to sudden changes. The most commonly used inputs for this purpose are:                                 (1)  the unit step input,                                (2)  the unit ramp input, and                                  (3)  the unit parabolic input.                            In terms of a position control system, these correspondences to (1) a step position input,                        (2) a step velocity input, and (3) a step acceleration input. Another standard test input is the                        sinusoid, which is of considerable importance since it provides a great deal of information                        about the system.","1 8 4  P E R F O R M A N C E   O F   C O N T R O L   S Y S T E M                      The complete response of the system to any of these test inputs will have a transient               component, determined by the natural frequencies and the initial conditions, as well as steady-               state component determined by the input signal.                 9.2  Steady State Error (or Performance)                       To maintain the output at the desired value with a minimum error is the ability of a               system.

The  envelope  of the  transient response  decays to 37% of its                   initial value in  seconds. The time constant of a stable system is defined in terms of the                   exponentially decaying character of the transient response. For 1st order and 2nd order                    underdamped systems, the transient terms have the form A e -t  and A e -t  cos(dt+)                   respectively   ( > 0). The time constant  is defined, as the time required of making the                   exponent  -t equal to -1.                                                                     Hence:        1                                                 (9-16)                                                                                                                                       For feedback control systems of order higher than two:    1  .                                                                               n                    These  five  quantities  are  relatively  easy  to  measure  when  a  step  response  is  already                   plotted. However, analytically these quantities are difficult to determine except for the                   simple cases.                  9.7  Response of First Order Systems                      Consider a 1st order  system  which represents a  speed control where  T is  the  time               constant of the motor.

We shall first obtain the response to a unit step input. This is given by:","P E R F O R M A N C E   O F   C O N T R O L   S Y S T E M     1 9 1                                          C   ) s (  =  k/T       k  /( k   ) 1    k  /( k   ) 1       (9-18)                                             s[s + (k + 1)/T]    s      s  k (   / ) 1  T                              and                                          ) t ( c  =  k    k  e      k (   / t ) 1  T                (9-19)                                             k + 1  k  1                         The response of the system is shown in below Fig.(9.7-2). It'll be seen that the steady-state                        value of the response is given by:                                                      Fig 9.7-2: Response of a 1st order system to a unit step input.                                               k                                      C  ss =  k + 1                                                   (9-20)                             This is less than one, the value of the input, but can be made close to one by increasing                        the amplifier gain k. The linear model is valid only up to a certain range of the inputs about                        the operating point. Hence, in all practical cases of this type, the steady-state error, given by:                                                       1                                      e ss =  C   -   1  ss =  k +1                                    (9-21)                         The time constant of the system is given by:                                        =   T                                                          (9-22)                                          k + 1                         This can be defined as the time required by the response to reach 63.2% of its steady-state                        value. Alternatively, the time constant may be defined as the time that the response would                        have taken to reach the steady state if it had continued to increase at the initial rate; we have:                                        dc    k   k (   / t ) 1  T                                   (9-23)                                              e                                       dt   T                              and                                       dc  ) 0 (    k    ;  so   =  k    ;  k  =  T                  (9-24)                                       dt      T        k + 1  T   k + 1                         Thus we see that this system will track the unit step input with a steady-state error of   T  , where                                                                                                    k  1                        T is the time constant of the open-loop system. If we apply a unit ramp input to the system, we can                        get:","1 9 2  P E R F O R M A N C E   O F   C O N T R O L   S Y S T E M                                  C  ) s (  =  k/T                                     s 2  s [   k (   / ) 1  ] T                                        k ( k    ) 1  kT  /( k   ) 1  2  kT  /( k   ) 1  2                                     =                                                      (9-25)                                        s 2          s        s   k (   / ) 1  T                   and                                 ) t ( c  =  k  t   kT    KT  e   k (   / t ) 1  T        (9-26)                                    k +1     k (   ) 1  2  k (   ) 1  2                    For large values of t, we can neglect the last term. Hence the error between the reference               input and the controlled output for such large values of t is given by:                               e(t) = r(t) - c(t) =   1  t   kT                               (9-27)                                               k  1    k (   ) 1  2                Since the error increases with time, and the steady-state error to a ramp input will approach               infinity as t approaches infinity.

The control of the print wheel requires that the               proper print character be placed in front of the hammer for hard-copy printing. The print               wheel is mounted directly on the motor shaft, and rotation can be made in either direction.                       The block diagram of the print wheel control system is shown in Fig 9.10-1. When a               command to print a certain character is given, the control system first interprets the total               distance and the direction to be traveled, and then commands the dc motor to drive the print               wheel to the correct position. Such a control system usually consists of two modes of","P E R F O R M A N C E   O F   C O N T R O L   S Y S T E M     1 9 9                           operation: the velocity mode and the position mode. When the command to travel a certain                        number of character positions is given by the set point, the velocity mode is first activated,                        and the motor-print wheel system is driven to follow a specific velocity profile, which is stored                        in the microprocessor controller.                            After the load is driven to the vicinity of the desired position, in the region between -a and                        0 or a and 0, as shown in Fig 9.10-1, depending on the direction of rotation, the system is                        switched to the position-control mode. The main purpose of the position mode is to null the                        position error, or drive the print wheel to point 0 as fast as possible without prolonged or                        excessive oscillations. The gain of the encoder for position control is determined by using the                        slope of the encoder output waveform at the equilibrium point.

The block diagram of the analog PID controller, where PID stands for Proportional,               Integral, and Derivative, is shown in fig10.5.1.                                                               Fig 10.5-1: PID Controller.                   k   is  implemented  digitally  by  a  gain  element.  Since  a  digital  computer  or  processor                     p               always has a finite digital word length. Most digital computers are based on the binary-number               system.                    The time derivative of a function f(t) at t = kT  can be approximated numerically by use of               the values of f(t) measured at t = kT  and  t = (k+1)T , that is                               df  ) t (    1                                             [f(kT)  - f((k  - 1)T)]                         (10.31)                               dt  t kT  T                    To find the z-transfer function of the derivative operation described numerically above we               take the z-transform on both sides, we have:                                   df  ) t (                  z                              Z              =    1   (1  z -  1 -  ) s ( F )  =  1  ) z ( F     (10.32)                                   dt  t kT   T              Tz                Thus, the z-transfer function of the digital differentiator is written:                                      G (z) = K D   z  1                                      (10.33)                                      D                                                  Tz                                                                                                      Ts                           D                   Where K  is the proportional constant of the derivative compensator.

So  when  the  sampling  period  T  approaches  zero,  G (z)  approaches  K   s  ,  which  is  the                                                                                     D                                                                   D               transfer function of the analog derivative compensator.","C O M P E N S A T O R     2 1 9                              For the integrator, we normally have a number of choices of digital approximation.

In practice, there are other numerical integration rules. Such as the trapezoidal integration,                        Simpson’s rule, and so on.                         The block of a digital PID controller is shown next:                                                          Fig 10.5-3:  Block diagram of a digital PID compensator.                            Once the transfer function of a digital compensator is determined, a digital processor or                        computer can implement the compensator. The operator z-1 is interpreted as a time delay of                        T  seconds,  where  T  is  the  sampling  period.  The  time  delay  is  implemented  by  storing  a","2 2 0  C O M P E N S A T O R                  variable in some convenient storage location in the computer and then taking it out after T               has clasped. For the digital differentiator, the transfer function is written:                                              K          1                                     G (z) =   T D  1 (  z  )                                (10.35)                                      D                For the digital integrator, it is:                                              K  Tz  1                                     G (z) =   I                                              (10.36)                                      I                                             1   z  1                    Any  continuous  data  compensator  can  be  made  into  a  digital  compensator  simply  by               adding sample and hold units at the input and the output terminals. The sampling period T               should  be  sufficiently  small  so  that  the  dynamic  characteristic  of  the  continuous-data               compensator is not lost through the digitization. The system shown below actually suggests               that given the continuous-data compensator G (s), the equivalent G (z) can be obtained as                                                            c                                                                                 c               shown.

The  locus  of  roots  of  the  transfer  function  of  the  bridged-T  network  is                        presented in dimensionless form. The transfer function of the bridged-T possesses two zeros;                        one or the other of which may be adjusted to fall upon any desired point in the half-plane,                        including any complex conjugate pair.

The transfer functions of these networks have two poles and two zeros. The poles are                        always negative and real, but the zeros can be made negative real or complex, with negative                        real parts depending on the ratio of capacitance.","2 2 2  D I G I T A L   C O N T R O L                                                    Fig. 11.1-1: Common types of bridged-T configuration.

The poles are dependent on the zero locations. The same transfer function can be obtained               just  by  switching  their  resistance  and  capacitance.

Further, since the damping ratio is invariant with scale change, the designer has only to               change scale by selecting the proper value of   1   to adjust the complex zeros to any desired                                                          R  1 C               values on the required  line.                     Direct readings of poles and zeros can be obtained only under the condition that   1  (a)                                                                                               RC  2                    1               or      (b) equal unity. These factors are therefore the scale factors for the determination of                  R 1 C               the actual pole-zero locations.

Fig 11.5-1: Loading impedance.                    This  is  applied  to  observe  the  locus  of  the  pole-zero  change  of  the  original  transfer               function  when  variable  load  impedance  is  connected  across  its  output  terminals.  The               following  steps  can  obtain  the  pole-zero  change  of  the  network  transfer  function  due  to               loading:                1.  Having  determined  the  original  unloaded  system  transfer  function,  use  Thevenin’s                   theorem  to  find  a  new  transfer  function  with  load  impedance    Z(s)  placed  across  the                   output terminal.                2.  Convert this function into an equivalent feedback control system.                3.  Apply the root-locus technique to the equivalent control system in step 2. The roots of the                   locus plot now show the changing poles and zeros under the variable load conditions.                The three steps are analyzed as follows:                    Suppose G(s) is the original unloaded voltage transfer function, Z(s) is the load impedance               function and G’(s) is the new transfer function including load impedance Z(s).

Generally, the effect of loading can be used to adjust                             the pole positions of the transfer function of the bridged-T. While it is impossible to fix                             both poles at will, one can fix the pole, which is, must significant.                                The  bridged-T  without  load  should  be  designed first  by  consultation  of  the  design                             charts. Zeros of this network are fixed as the desired positions; then the complete pole-                             zero configuration of G(s) is obtained. Modifications of G(s) by loading effects are made                             by selecting the proper type of loading. The exact pole-zero location of G’(s) is obtained                             by applying the root-locus technique to the equivalent control system Z’(s)/Z(s).","2 3 0  D I G I T A L   C O N T R O L                          Design Of A Hydraulic Control System                   11.7  Design                                                          Fig 11.7-1: Hydraulic system block diagram.

The impulse response of this network is the voltage v (t) when the input voltage v (t) is an                                                                                               i                                                                     0               impulse. Since the voltage v (t) appears across the 1 resistor, the energy dissipated in this                                          0               resistor is equal to the integral of the impulse response squared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2                             Energy  =  ( volts x Amps)dt =  ( v (t)) dt                                                                  0                                                              0                                         0","D I G I T A L   C O N T R O L     2 3 5                                                                                                          2                                               =   0  f (t)dt                                         (11.41)                            Taking one more important step; because the voltage impulse is present only at t=0, the                        energy  which  is  finally  dissipated  in  the  one  ohm  resistor  must  be  initially  stored  in  the                                      +                        network at t=0 .                            In the case of the impulse input, this energy is initially stored on the first inductor as an                        initial current.

Stability                    In order to determine the stability, we must first determine the characteristic equation. By               using the following formula:                                                      2                                          -1                                     (sI-A)   =    R  0 s  R 1 s   R  2                     (P-1.3)                                                 3                                                        2                                                s  d 1 s  d 2 s  d 3                                      2                              3                        -1               det[(sI-A) ] = s  d 1 s  d 2 s  d                                               3                              3    2                              = s  - 6s  + 11s -6                                        5 j  5                                = (s+1)   s                                           2                  The system has poles at:   = 11 and  2,3  =   5 2 j  5                                       1                Since the poles are on the right side of the s-plane the system is unstable.

The first staring point is at                        (0.2,0.1); graph 7 shows that derivation, and the plot is increasing to infinity. The same for the                        starting  point  (2.,  2.)  for  graph  8.  Vander  pole‟s  graph  proves  these  results  are  corrects.                        Because the Vander pole‟s graphs show that the plot, as is shown below, goes to the infinity,                        so the system is unstable.","2 5    6      S T A T E   F E E D B A C K   D E S I G

When analyzing and designing a control system, it is easier to deal with low-order transfer                        functions than to deal with high order transfer functions. There are numerous techniques for                        reduction of transfer functions, but almost all the reduction techniques are based on the use of                        dominant roots.

It  has  also  shown                        adding a Compensator can improve the response of a system but over compensation can also                        decrease the performance of the system, such as an increased rise time.","PROJECT 4                     CONVEYOR BELT DRIVE                SYSTEM                        1-   The  calculation  for  a  conveyor  is  shown  next,  which  runs  at  a  constant  speed  of  200               ft/min. with on off as described. Set up the transfer function for the system and simulate the               motion of the conveyor belt with an on-off unit step input to the motor. The motor specs are               also  attached.  Assuming  that  the  belt  speed  is  as  shown  in  Figure  1.,  plot  your  simulated               results on top of the desired speed. The motor is to be driven directly from a constant voltage               supply. All chains, wheels, and reducers are assumed to be ideal.                 2-   Place a tachometer (specs. are also given) at drive wheel 2. Use the tachometer output               (voltage)  for  unity  feedback  to  a  summer,  which  drives  a  power  operational  amplifier  for               driving the motor. Set up a reference input so that the speed of the motor can be controlled               for 50, 100, 150, and 200 ft/min. conveyer speed. Repeat the simulation for each speed with a               desired speed diagram shown in Figure 1., but with new speeds for each run.                 Conveyor Drive System Specifications:                System Requirements:                    A motor must be selected to mate with existing drive components. The conveyor and               load must be accelerated from rest to 200 ft/min in 0.5 sec, driven at constant speed for 14               sec  and  decelerated  to  rest  in  0.5  sec.  For  the  worst-case  analysis,  the  cycle  is  repeated               continuously.  The  drive  train  description  and  motion  profile  are  shown  in  Figs  1  and  2,               respectively.                Load Calculations:                    The first step in the system analysis is to calculate the load at the motor shaft. In this               case, the customer did not know all the inertial loads, but mechanical dimensions and weights               of  each  were  furnished.  From  this  data,  the  moments  of  inertia  can  be  calculated.  All","P R O J E C T   4   3 0 1                          moments of inertia are calculated here as equivalent moments of inertia at the moments of                        inertia at the motor shaft.

Note: In this example, the mass m of individual parts of the drive mechanism is calculated in                                 2                        units (oz-s /in), not in (slug). This is more convenient because the moments of inertia, J, are                                            2                        calculated  in  (oz.in.s )  and  no  conversion  factors  have  to  be  used.  The  mass  m  is  thus                        calculated from given weight W (oz) as follows:                                                                    2                                                                               2                                              m   W         [oz.s /in ; oz ; in/s ]                   (P-4.1)                                                   g                                                 2                        Where: g = 386.0878 in/s  is the standard gravitational acceleration.

Let‟s evaluate the next larger unit available, a model E-               703 with the following characteristic:                              K  = 24.5  oz.in/A                  R = 0.26  @ 25 C                               T                                             2                             J  = 0.2  oz.in.s                   D = 10  oz.in/krpm                              m                              T  = 15  oz.in (maximum)            R  = 1.2  C/W                                                                   th                               f","P R O J E C T   4   3 0 7                                                              Solution                                The objective is to provide to simulate the performance of a control system modeled                        after a real physical plant. The plant is a conveyor belt drive system. The problem is to set up                        the transfer function of the system and to simulate the motion of the conveyor belt with an                        on-off  unit  step  input  to  the  motor.  The  simulation  was  run  again  for  four  conveyor  belt                        speeds  but  a  tachometer  was  placed  in  the  feedback  loop.  The  results  of  the  open  loop                        simulation and closed loop simulations were compared to their desired belt speeds.                          Procedures                             The first step in solving this problem is to write a differential equation describing the                        motion of the motor and the load. The resulting differential equation for this system is shown                        below:                                                                                                               J                                                                B                                                     d                                                                                                                                                              R m      R m      , v                       (P-4.5)                                                K T   dt    K T                          Where K  is a motor constant, J is the total moment of inertia, B is the friction coefficient,                                T                        and R  is the motor resistance. The values used are those of the E-703 motor and are listed                             m                        below:                                                                     2                              B = 1.8  oz.in.s      J = 1.595  oz.in.s                               R  = 0.26  ohms                      K  = 24.5  oz.in/A                                                                     T                                m                             The  next  step  will  be  to  take  the  Laplace  transform  of  the  differential  equation  and                        rearrange terms to arrive at the desired transfer function of the plant. The resulting transfer                        function is given below:                                        W   ) s (    K T     B   59 . 08                                                   / s                                          (P-4.6)                                                   J                                          ) s ( V    R m     J    s   . 1  12853                             To find the response of the system to a unit step input, the equation above is multiplied                        by 1/s, the Laplace transform of u(t), and the inverse Laplace transform is taken. The resulting                        equation is shown below.                                       W = (52.3 - 52.3e -1.1285t ) v                                   (P-4.7)                             For the first part, the open loop transfer function, the desired belt speed was 200 ft/min,                        which corresponds to W = 150 rad/sec. Using the above equation and steady-state conditions,                        a reference voltage of 2.87 volts must be applied. Using this information, a simulation of the                        conveyor belt speed was run and plotted on top of the desired belt speed. This is shown in                        Fig.3.","3 0 8      C O N V E Y O R   B E L T   D R I V E   S Y S T E M                                                      Fig 3: Plot of open loop with reference voltage of 2.87 volts.                     The next step in this project was to place a tachometer at the drive wheel turning the               conveyor belt and use its output as feedback. The output of the tachometer must be amplified               in order to have an effect on the system and will be shown shortly.                    The  Laplace  transform  of  the  tachometer  with  gain  is  H(s)  =  0.03K.  Therefore,  the               overall transfer function for the closed-loop system is now shown to be                               W   ) s (     59 . 08                                                                                             (P-4.8)                                  ) s ( V  s   . 1  1285  . 1  77 K                    Now  several  procedures  must  be  applied  to  solve  for  K.  First,  the  inverse  Laplace               transform is taken of the above equation and is found to be                               W      59 . 08   1 e  . 1 (   1285 177 K  t )  v          (P-4.9)                                    . 1  1285  . 1  77 K                    For all of the desired belt speeds, we can require that steady state is reached within 1% by               0.5 seconds. For this to be possible, the following relation must hold,               0.01 = e -(1.1285+1.77K)0.5 .                Solving for K results in K = 4.56. Therefore, with a gain of K = 4.56, all of the desired speeds               will be reached within 0.5 seconds.                    Now we can find the necessary voltage to drive the motor. This can be found from the               following relationship for a belt speed of 200 ft/min or W  = 150 rad/sec.                                                                     0                               150        59 . 08     v                                     . 1  1285  . 1  77  . 4 (  56 )                               v   1379 . 955    23 . 357    volts                           (P-4.10)                                   59 . 08                    The corresponding voltages necessary for the order desired belt speeds can be found in a               similar manner and the results are shown below.","P R O J E C T   4   3 0 9                                         Belt speed = 150 ft/min             = 17.52 volts                                                   = 100                   = 11.68                                                   = 50                    = 5.84                         The simulations for each belt speed are shown in Figs 4, 5, 6, and 7.
