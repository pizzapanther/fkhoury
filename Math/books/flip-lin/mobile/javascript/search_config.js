Special thanks to Galveston College students for there motivation to write this                   book.                       About This Book                     The purpose of this book to provide my students to be used in my classroom as                   notes.                    It is written to my style of teaching.                    Most of the information in this book are from several books which most have                   been referred under references and some are not because I have no information                   which books are from, some are from my College days.","","P RE F A CE  | i                                                                                                         

 A system of equations is a set of one or more equations involving two or more variables.                  The solutions to systems of equations are the variable mappings such that all these equations                  intersect, no intersection, or a unique infinite solution.                    1.1−2       Matrices                    A matrix is a rectangle array of real numbers, arranged in rows and columns.

A direct graph starts with n nodes. There are  n possible edges, each edge leaves one of the n                       nodes and enters one of the n nodes (possibly itself). The n by n adjacency matrix has  a = 1                                                                                                            ij                                                                                     0                       when edge leaves node i and enter node j; if no edge then a = .

This is also the signed volume of the n−dimensional parallelepiped spanned by the column or row                  vectors of the matrix.

knowledge of Minors and Cofactors is compulsory in the computation of adjoint of a matrix and                  hence in its inverse as well as in the computation of determinant of a square matrix. This technique of                  computing determinant is known as Cofactor Expansion. This method can be used for any (nn×   )                   and most important this method in programing.                                   a     a      a                                   11    12     13       a     a          a     a         a     a                                  a 21  a 22  a 23  =  a 11  a 22  a 23  −  a 12  a 21  a 23  +  a 13  a 21  a 22                                   a 31  a 32  a 33        32     33        31    33        31    32                    1.6−6a  Minor                   For a square matrix  A =        a ij       , the minor  M .

The direction of flow in each branch is indicated, and the flow amount is either shown or is denoted                  by a variable.                   In a network model, you assume that the total flow into a junction is equal to the total flow out of the                  junction.                     Example 1.8-1                   Set up a system of linear equations to represent the network shown below.

You are in an airplane flying from Chicago to Boston for a job interview. The compass in the                cockpit of the plane shows that your plane is pointed due East, and the airspeed indicator on the                plane shows that the plane is traveling through the air at 400 mph. there is a crosswind that                affects your plane however, and the crosswind is blowing due South at 40 mph.                Given the crosswind you wonder; relative to the ground, in what direction are you really flying                and how fast are you really traveling?            29.  A jet airliner, flying due east at 500 mph in still air, encounters a 70-mph tailwind blowing in                the direction 60° north of east. The airplane holds its compass heading due east but, because of                the wind, acquires a new ground speed and direction. What speed and direction should the                jetliner have in order for the resultant vector to be 500 mph due east?            30.

If the zero vector 0 W∈                       The most fundamental ideas in linear algebra are that the plane is a subspace of the full vector                              n                     space   .                                                                                   3                    Every subspace contains the zero vector.

The sum of v =  (2, 3 and w =  ( 3,−  −  2 ) is           ( 1, 1−  ) which is outside the quarter-plane. Two quarter-planes don’t make a subspace.             2.5−5       Example                           C           The Subspace  (−∞   , ∞ )           There is a theorem in calculus which states that a sum of continuous functions is continuous and than           a constant times a continuous frunction is continuous.

An orthogonal set in which each vector has norm 1 is said to                  be orthonormal.                     3.3−2       Theorem                                                                                                                                                                                        1.

This is an approach to linear algebra that does not start with matrices.
